Framework for Reactive Systems in Go

During the last decade, the rise of disruptive, cutting-edge technologies was shaking up
the developer communities in the field of computer science. The top dogs among the
technology leaders were using their own developments to cope with massive data streams
and high customer expectations about responsiveness. These systems are described
concisely as Reactive Systems in [The Reactive Manifesto](http://http://www.reactivemanifesto.org). Nowadays, these systems
are known as cloud and offered as a service (aaS).
At the same time, the price reduction of edge devices leads to another major topic, IoT.
But the expected scenarios in IoT seem to be only partially manageable by the approach
of current cloud technology. Mainly due to two reasons, the further increase of the data
magnitudes and the demands of time critical applications.
As an obvious consequence, the top architecture has to be transformed once again from
a more centralized approach to a decentralized and distributed one.
